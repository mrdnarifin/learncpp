// Define a program-defined type named Fraction so the compiler understands what a Fraction is
// (we'll explain what a struct is and how to use them lates in this chapter)
// This only defines what a Fraction type looks like, it doesn't create one 

struct Fraction
{
    
    int numerator {};
    int denominator {};
};

// Now we can make use of our Fraction type
int main()
{
    Fraction f { 3, 4}; // this actually instantiates a Fraction object named f

    return 0;
}
